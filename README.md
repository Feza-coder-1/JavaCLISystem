//1. Employee Management System
//Concepts: Interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, file operations.
//Description:
//Create an Employee abstract class with common attributes like id, name, salary, and methods like calculateSalary().
//Define multiple subclasses (e.g., FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee) that inherit from Employee and implement the calculateSalary() method differently.
//Implement an interface like FileOperations with methods for reading and writing employee data to a file.
//Store employee data (such as name, salary, and type) in a file and implement methods to read and write this data to a CSV file.
